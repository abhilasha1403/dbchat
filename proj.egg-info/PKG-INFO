1. Introduction:
Data-domain large model framework. Its purpose is to build the infrastructure for the large model domain by developing a variety of technical capabilities, including multi-model management, Text2SQL performance optimization, RAG framework and optimization. These capabilities aim to simplify and facilitate the construction of large model applications around databases.
